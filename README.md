## Usage Manual

In order to try the typing test, run the `main` Python script with the following command line arguments:
- `-utm` or `--use_time_mode`: determine the ending condition of the typing test (limit either the time or the number of tries);
- `-mv MAX_VALUE` or `--max_value MAX_VALUE`: depending on the ending condition mode selected, this is used to enter either the maximum number of seconds during which the program is allowed to run, or the maximum number of tries allowed for the user.

The `-h` or `--help` option will give you same information on how to run the Python script that is given here.
